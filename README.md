# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** used in modern cloud engineering environments.

The pipeline automatically:

• Builds container images
• Performs vulnerability scanning
• Validates code on every push
• Ensures secure application delivery

This architecture simulates **real enterprise DevOps workflows**.

# 🐳 Docker Container

The application runs inside a **Docker container**, ensuring:

• consistent runtime environment
• easy deployment
• scalable infrastructure

---

# 🔐 Security Scanning

The pipeline integrates **Trivy vulnerability scanning** to detect:

• dependency vulnerabilities
• OS package risks
• configuration weaknesses

This follows **DevSecOps best practices**.

---

# 📈 CI/CD Automation

Every push automatically triggers:

GitHub Actions workflow which performs:

✔ Code checkout
✔ Docker build
✔ Security scanning

---
